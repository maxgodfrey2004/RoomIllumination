  <h1>Room Illumination Simulations</h1>
  <p>
    This website contains simulations I have written for George Tokarsky in my
    capacity as a Summer Mathematics Research Assistant at the University of
    Alberta in 2023. The project website can be found
    <a href="https://gwtokarsky.github.io">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have recorded several of my simulations and put them up on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC5ogb7cNSVzj0DHsUtQDwg">George Tokarsky's Youtube</a>:
